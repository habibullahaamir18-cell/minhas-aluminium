IMPORTANT: You must add these environment variables to your Railway project for image uploads to work.

1. Go to your Railway Dashboard.
2. Select your "backend" service.
3. Go to the "Variables" tab.
4. Add the following variables (copy and paste exactly):

VARIABLE NAME: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
VALUE: dnysxaoqr

VARIABLE NAME: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
VALUE: 484485419939377

VARIABLE NAME: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
VALUE: slnoX0DAjkHdWEXiXZIA8cMjpRY

Once added, Railway will automatically redeploy. After redeployment (wait 2-3 minutes), image uploads will work.
